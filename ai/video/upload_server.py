"""
ai/video/upload_server.py

HTTP API backing the dashboard's "Analyze" page: upload a recorded clip
against a saved camera, get back one plain report of what the AI found in
it — objects, vehicle plates, faces, and (if that camera has a restricted
zone configured) intrusion events.

A camera is REQUIRED (not optional): every intrusion/vehicle/activity event
found is POSTed to the backend as an alert tagged source="video_analysis"
(so the dashboard can tell it apart from a live camera's own alerts), and
an alert has to belong to a real, already-created camera. So the frontend
should not let anyone reach this page until they've created at least one
camera.

This is intentionally simple otherwise: no live MJPEG preview, no shared
preview ports, no dependency on a live camera worker being up. Upload ->
process in a background thread -> poll for the finished report, which is
saved to the dashboard as it's produced.
